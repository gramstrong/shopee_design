        <p>Color is the most important visual channel in a visual experience, but also an important means of assisting product design to accomplish its efficacy and purpose. After studying the visual norms of the mainstream platform and the conclusions drawn in practice, Modular Design has established a set of palette systems. This system has the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>consider the brand's identity, combined with business and interaction needs, with a view to effective information transmission, operational guidelines, interactive feedback</li>
          <li>The color should match the product positioning and conform to the user's psychological cognition</li>
          <li>Avoid using complex swatches as much as possible and giving them reason to avoid wasting design effort</li>
          <li>Sgit ctrive for barrier-free design, to comply with WCAG 2.0 standards, to ensure adequate contrast, so that color is more likely to be identified as obstacles</li>
        </ul>
